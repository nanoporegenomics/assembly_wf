# Shasta configuration for the CARD protocol:

# - Human genome.
# - Guppy 5.0.7 with "super" accuracy.
# - Single flowcell (100-140 Gb of coverage).
# - Read N50 around 30 Kb.
# - Haploid assembly.

# This was optimized for CARD sample NABEC_SH-92-14_FTX.
# On that sample, it assembled 2864 Mb of sequence with 
# an N50 of 28.4 Mb, despite the high chimera rate
# and relatively low coverage.
